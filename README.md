# Hyperlink-Induced Topic Search (HITS) and Page Rank Alogrithm: Java Implementation
For any search engine to display properly the returned web pages, a proper ranking algorithm must be used to sort such pages based on their relevancy.
These graph-based algorithms are used for link analysis in order to rate web pages. In this project, we show a working Java implementation of Kleinberg’s HITS Algorithm, and Google’s PageRank algorithm.
